## Version 1.1.2:

* Non-English users can now select the Wikipedia language of choice 
  from the Preferences window

* Images and pre-formatted content will be re-sized to fit within the 
  reading width

* Additional support for multi-page articles. A navigation pane is provided 
  at the top and bottom of the web page to navigate to the Next or Previous 
  page or to a specific numbered page/link, if available

* Code changes to use String Bundles for future localization

* Improved handling of formatted links in the Tranquil Browsing Mode

* If the Print or Single Page View does not return sufficient content 
  Tranquility will now try to process the original page. This may help 
  in some cases where the Print or Single Page View is available only 
  to registered/premium users

* Users can now select the pruning strategy used by Tranquility in its 
  attempt to get a readable web page. The default option is a 
  Conservative pruning strategy. The Moderate and Aggressive pruning 
  strategies may result in truncation of relevant/useful content depending 
  on the structure of the web page
