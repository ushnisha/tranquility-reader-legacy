## Version 1.1.6:

* Ability to add notes/annotations to offline content; Select a 
  portion of the text and right click to get the context menu 
  "Tranquility - Add Annotation" to add a new annotation.

* The annotation is saved automatically and can be retrieved 
  later. Selected text can be highlighted with a custom color.

* A summary of all the annotations is available via the 
  "View Notes" button. This is a convenient way to collate 
  all notes and compile them for a report (or for later review).

* Please note that at this time, annotations, once added, 
  cannot be edited or deleted. Annotation font sizes are 
  fixed and are not user customizable. 
  These features will be added in a later version.

* The layout of the tranquility mode has been streamlined 
  and given a more minimal appearance. Buttons have been 
  moved from the side to the top. The reading area border 
  has been removed to improve readability.

--------------------------

## Version 1.1.4:

* "Read Later" functionality to store tranquility view of pages for 
  offline reading

* Easy access to "Offline Links" view toolbar menu item or in the 
  tranquility view.

* Easy deletion of articles after reading them

* Unclutter your bookmarks menu by saving them as offline pages

--------------------------

## Version 1.1.3:

### Minor enhancements:

* Support for customization of link color, line width, text-justification.

### Bug fixes:

* Code modified from version 1.1.2 to take care of a corner case where 
  the tranquility version reversed the display order of all the 
  paragraphs in the web page. 

--------------------------

## Version 1.1.2:

* Non-English users can now select the Wikipedia language of choice 
  from the Preferences window

* Images and pre-formatted content will be re-sized to fit within the 
  reading width

* Additional support for multi-page articles. A navigation pane is provided 
  at the top and bottom of the web page to navigate to the Next or Previous 
  page or to a specific numbered page/link, if available

* Code changes to use String Bundles for future localization

* Improved handling of formatted links in the Tranquil Browsing Mode

* If the Print or Single Page View does not return sufficient content 
  Tranquility will now try to process the original page. This may help 
  in some cases where the Print or Single Page View is available only 
  to registered/premium users

* Users can now select the pruning strategy used by Tranquility in its 
  attempt to get a readable web page. The default option is a 
  Conservative pruning strategy. The Moderate and Aggressive pruning 
  strategies may result in truncation of relevant/useful content depending 
  on the structure of the web page
