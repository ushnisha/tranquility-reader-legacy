# Tranquility Reader Legacy

Tranquility Reader is a Firefox extension that improves the readability 
of web articles.

Tranquility removes unnecessary elements in a webpage, and provides a 
simple and tranquil reading experience. Similar functionality is 
available through Readability or iReader or "Reader Mode" in Firefox. 
Please try the built in "Reader Mode" first and then consider 
Tranquility Reader only if some of the features available only in 
Tranquility Reader are critical for you.

## To use tranquility you can:

* Click on the navigation-bar icon to transform the page in the Desktop Version
* Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T

## Features

* Compatible with NoScript
* Various options to customize font size, font color, etc.  Please look at
  the options/preferences UI for more details.

## Compatibility
Tranquility Reader Legacy was developed using the legacy addon technology.
As a result it will NOT work on Firefox version 57.0 or later versions.
This repository has been created to preserve the old code in case it is removed
from the Mozilla addons repository and for use with other Firefox forks like
Palemoon or Waterfox.

## Support
At this time, this code is completely unsupported.  Depending on the time
available to the author, changes may be committed.  Please follow this README
to check if there are updates on this policy.
